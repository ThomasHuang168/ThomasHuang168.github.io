&lt;p&gt;One day â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have long been thinking to make my personal website but I do not want to spend too much time on it. I need to focus on content instead of layout and the post help me to remember my old thought as well as my personal networking tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day my colleague recommended &lt;a href="https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin"&gt;P403n1x87/Austin&lt;/a&gt; to me and as a habit I also looked up to developer's &lt;a href="https://p403n1x87.github.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;this awesome website management tool&lt;/a&gt;. I know there are better tools elsewhere but this is good enough for me to start my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About how to host pelican on github pages, I refered to &lt;/p&gt;
